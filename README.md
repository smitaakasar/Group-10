Heart Attack Risk Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques
This project aims to predict the risk of heart attacks using advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical patient data, the system identifies key risk factors and provides insights into an individualâ€™s likelihood of experiencing a heart attack.
**Key Features**
Input Variables: Age, Gender, Cholesterol, Blood Pressure, Max Heart Rate, etc.
Dataset: UCI Heart Disease Dataset.
Target: Predict heart attack risk (1: High Risk, 0: Low Risk).
**Methodology**
Data Preprocessing: Scaling and feature selection.
Model Training: Evaluated models include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, and Neural Network.
Model Interpretation: LIME
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
**Clone the repository:**
git clone https://github.com/Group-10/heart-attack-risk-prediction.git
cd heart-attack-risk-prediction
